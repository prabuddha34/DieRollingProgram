 Die Rolling Program
This is a simple Java-based dice rolling simulator that allows users to input the number of dice they want to roll. The program then:
Randomly generates results for each die roll (values between 1 and 6).
Displays each result alongside an ASCII representation of the corresponding die face.
Calculates and prints the total sum of all dice rolled.
This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as:
User input using Scanner
Random number generation with Random
Control flow using loops and switch
